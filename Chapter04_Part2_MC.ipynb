    "Often we need to find the maximum or minimum of a particular function $f(x)$ where $f$ is a scalar function but $x$ could be a vector. Typical applications are the minimisation of entities such as cost, risk and error, or the maximisation of productivity, efficiency and profit. Optimisation routines typically provide a method to minimise a given function: if we need to maximise $f(x)$ we create a new function $g(x)$ that reverses the sign of $f$, i.e. $g(x)=â€…âˆ’â€…f(x)$ and we minimise $g(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we provide an example showing (i) the definition of the test function and (ii) the call of the `scipy.optimize.fmin` function which takes as argument a function f to minimise and an initial value $x_0$ from which to start the search for the minimum, and which returns the value of $x$ for which $f(x)$ is (locally) minimised. Typically, the search for the minimum is a local search, i.e. the algorithm follows the local gradient. We repeat the search for the minimum for two values ($x_0â€„=â€„1.0$ and $x_0â€„=â€„2.0$, respectively) to demonstrate that depending on the starting value we may find different minimar of the function f.\n",
